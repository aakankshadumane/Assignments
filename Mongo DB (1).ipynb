    "#Q1 What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database. It is designed to store and manage large volumes \n of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "Non-relational databases handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data.It has various \n data models, such as key-value, document, column-family, and graph, to suit different types \n of data and use cases.They often prioritize performance and can handle \n large amounts of data and high-speed data ingestion and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in the following scenarios:\n",
    "1. Unstructured or Semi-structured Data\n",
    "2. MongoDB's document-oriented data model makes it suitable for use cases involving complex data structures, \n nested data, and hierarchical relationships."

    "# Q2 State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "Document-Oriented:Documents are similar to JSON objects and can have nested structures,\n making it easy to represent complex data models. \n",
    "Schema Flexibility: his flexibility enables developers to iterate and evolve \n the data model without downtime or schema migrations. \n",
    "Scalability and High Availability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally \n across multiple servers or nodes, allowing for high-volume data storage and handling.\n",
    "Querying and Indexing: It provides support for rich queries, including filtering, \n sorting, and field projection. MongoDB also supports secondary indexes.\n",
    "Replication and Fault Tolerance:MongoDB supports replica sets, which are self-healing \n clusters consisting of primary and multiple secondary nodes. \n Replica sets provide automatic failover, data redundancy, and fault tolerance. \n If the primary node fails, one of the secondary nodes automatically takes \n over as the new primary, ensuring high availability and minimizing downtime."
